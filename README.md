Efrat Cohen & Shoval Benayon


*Purpose of project:*

Design of dashboards and analytics in the capture of replica data that harnesses Databases NoSQL, tools from
Hadoop ecosystem and service-oriented concept in typical architecture and implementation of infrastructure integration challenges.
Functional requirements
• The system will enable the management of sections of the road. For Road 5, see sections of Road 6.

• At any moment you can know the number of vehicles in each section.

• For vehicles entering and leaving vehicles on a regular basis, a simulator will generate these events and drag updates.

• Each event will include data such as: event type (road entry / section entry / exit road / exit section (section, type
Car (private, commercial, truck (, day of the week, hour, is a special day) in case of holidays or exceptions ).

• The system will display on a dashboard the current number of vehicles and will allow you to request a list of vehicles.

• The system will build a prediction model based on a decision tree: giving details of the road section, type of vehicle, day of the week and time
Entry will be predicted from which section the car will exit.

• You can display the Matrix Confusion screen and ask to start evaluating the model: every time the simulator sends
A notice of a vehicle entering the road will be predicted for the exit section, and as soon as the vehicle leaves, it will be updated whether it was right or wrong and an index
Accuracy will be calculated and represented dynamically.
